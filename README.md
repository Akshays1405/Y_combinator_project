# ðŸ§ª Litmus Check Take Home Assignment

Welcome to the Litmus Check take home assignment 

## Instructions

This assignment has three questions as outlined below. When you are done, please email the assignment to mehul [at] litmuscheck.com


### Question 1

In this assignment, you will create a script on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) using JavaScript and Microsoft's [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework. 

1. Install node modules by running `npm i`.

2. Edit the `index.js` file in this project to go to [Hacker News/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) and validate that EXACTLY the first 100 articles are sorted from newest to oldest. You can run your script with the `node index.js` command.

Note that you are welcome to update Playwright or install other packages as you see fit, however you must utilize Playwright with JS or TS in this assignment.

### Question 2

Create a test plan for functional testing of the page [Hacker News/newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) and include as a file in the submission. 

### Question 3

Why do you want to work at Litmus Check? Please record a short, ~2 min video using [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) that includes:

1. Your answer (~2 mins)

2. A walk-through demonstration of your code, showing a successful execution (~2 mins)

3. An overview of the test plan you created (~1 min)

The answer and walkthrough should be combined into *one* video of not more than 5 mins and must be viewable without download or sign-in, preferably using Loom.


While the assignment has clear requirements, we encourage applicants to treat it as more than a checklist. If you're genuinely excited about Litmus Check, consider going a step furtherâ€”whether that means building a simple user interface, adding detailed error handling or reporting, improving the structure of the script, or anything else that showcases your unique perspective.

There's no "right" answerâ€”we're curious to see what you choose to do when given freedom and ambiguity. In a world where tools can help generate working code quickly and make it easier than ever to complete technical take-homes, we value originality and intentionality. If that resonates with you, use this assignment as a chance to show us how you think.

Applicants who approach the assignment as a creative challenge, not just a checklist, tend to perform best in our process.
